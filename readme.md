### üíª Practical Project: Process Monitor

‚ö† Warning ‚ö†<br>
Terminating important or system processes may cause system instability or shutdown. Proceed with caution!<br>

This is a visual interface for monitoring and managing processes on Windows and MacOS, built with .NET 8.<br>
Example of view ‚¨áÔ∏è
![Service preview](1.png)
![Service details](2.png)

**Features**
- Display all active processes in the system
- Show thread count, memory usage, and process name
- Change process priority
- Terminate processes (Kill process)
- View detailed process information and all system environment variables (not only for a specific process).
- Writes logs into the .txt file with support for concurrent access

**Technologies:**
- `System.Diagnostics`
- `Environment`
- `Thread`, `Task`, `lock`, `ThreadPriority`
- `FileStream`, `FileShare`
- `SignalR`
- `AutoMapper`
- `Angular`
- `.NET 8`
- `Process.GetProcesses()`
